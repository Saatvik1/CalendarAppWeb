# CalendarAppWeb


# The purpose of this video is simply to show the function of the program I made. 





Goals for future: 
Make a group class, find a way to extract emails from the group and display it on the website
Move things to a database, there shared circles will connect to google calendars, make a new calendar, 
and have shared events. 

When able to view same events on a (different than default, and shared) calendar, start
implementing feature where you can view free time. 
Could have a second calendar underneath the first showing free time on a weekly basis in the circle. 



IF user clicks once on the date, it will open a window to add 
all the elements to make an event and when click add or delete on that 
popup window

if user double clicks, they can see the hourly time period for that day 
there they can add events, see current events, and edit events.
